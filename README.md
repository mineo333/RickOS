# RickOS

RickOS is a fun little side project that I've been working on over this summer (Summer of 2021). The ultimate goal of this OS is to obtain a more complete understanding of how a computer works past just memory which has thus far been my specialty.

The reason it's called RickOS is because the ultimate goal of this OS is to reach a userspace whose sole purpose is to play of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" along wiht ASCII art of the dancing. The reason I chose this goal is because it involves file systems, device drivers, vga drivers, memory, and pretty much everything that is involved in the creation of an OS.
